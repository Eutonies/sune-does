                                    It's a funny thing about dreams: entire fields of study have been dedicated to uncovering their secret meanings and unlocking a path
                                    into the deepest, darkest parts of our subconscience yet to me, they have always seemed pretty straight forward: whatever unfinished 
                                    thoughts are left on the workdesk of the mind at the end of the day are shredded in the garbage disposal before being flushed out of the
                                    mind's piping. As a matter of fact, during a couple of years of my mid-30's I thought I had reached some state of mental cleansiness
                                    that made dreaming superfluous since I had stopped having them (as it turns out I probably had dreams, but sustaining a sleep schedule
                                    of 5.5 hours of sleep a night lowered my quality of sleep enough so that I couldn't remember them when I woke up 🤷‍).

                                    During January of 2024, I tried getting into <b><i>lucid dreaming</i></b>. I listened to an audio book on the subject, and one thing that
                                    was stressed throughout the book was, to keep a <i>dream journal</i> in which you write down what you have experienced while dreaming
                                    as soon as you wake up, and I did just that. Other suggestions for training the ability to distinguish between awake- and dream-state
                                    included having a series of <i>reality checks</i> you perform regularly throughout the day, so I tattooed the word <b>VÅGEN</b> (English: AWAKE) 
                                    on my wrist, and would check it rigorously during the day.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the end, I had a couple of dreams during which I became aware that I was dreaming, but I didn't become omnipotent and I couldn't fly,
                                    and then I got cold feet: <i>"imagine if I end up always being aware that I am dreaming, but unable to do what I want and just
                                    end up putting in more hours working (!)"</i>. I might pick up the practice again at some point, but in the meantime I present to 
                                    any die-hard Freudians out there a challenge to derive any kind of meaning or reason out of the nonsense that was my dreams of January 2024.
                                    I have had to translate my diary from Danish, and I have anonymised a few names here and there but otherwise, the entries are as I wrote them down.
                                    Re-reading my notes in November 2024, there are a couple of entries that have made me go "WTF?!" and others I feel warrant an explanation, and 
                                    for these cases, I have a supplied a popup with additional details. Enjoy!

                            EuroCup (soccer/football) 2024 was being played on the grass field in front of my apartment building. I had trouble googling why stadium equipment was being raised.

                            We were selling burgers and milkshakes. The BLACK MEAT was under no circumstances to be used (or maybe it was the white...?). I was a young man. I was incapable of grocery shopping and driving a car.<br/>
                            My dream diary appeared. Young woman was in trouble. She befriends my X-wife (not sure it was my actual X-wife). Romance ensues. The possibility of having to do whole-sale shopping loomed.

                            Threw some kind of huge party. I was multitasking, playing dodge ball and doing business. I think it was a birthday party for my son.<br/>

                            Son and I went to the TAP restaurant in Ballerup Centret. 2 people tried to steal my phone when I went to pay the bill. We went home.<br/>
                            Son took part in a disappearance-act in my honor. Old army-buddy also took part in the shenanigans but I was onto them, and pranked him (the army-buddy) that I would kill him with a knife.<br/>

                            There was some kind of get-together for a weird blend of people. Jacqueline was there. She hadn't changed much. My bicycle was also there; it had changed A LOT!<br/>
                            We visited an old man who could sell us hand grenades. I had to pee, but someone was in the bathroom. I decided to stop by the Mouh Goon, because it was just too much work the other way around.

                            For some reason, the company for which I work had raised a soccer/football stadium. While I was in a Teams meeting with my colleagues from Randers, I went into the stadium to pour a carton of milk onto the field in celebration/as a prank.<br/>
                            I had a hard time finding my way back to my car. I was being followed by two semi-large dudes. I asked them where they were going. They answered me in Danish. I turned back the way I had come from, in order not to lead them to my car. They followed me. I went to the center of a large parking area, and rolled up my sleeves. They ran towards me. I awakened as I threw a full-comital hay-maker at the first of them.

                            For the 3rd time, my X-wife gifted me a solo-trip to the United States. I didn't understand why, because I didn't really want to go to the United States.<br/>
                            I was drinking and popping various types of pills. During my trip, 2 middle-aged villains, one man and one woman, killed each other. First day of school - or it may have been first day back to work - I had a hangover.

                            There was a gang-war. Somebody got beat up with a bat. I think I mostly just watched.<br/>
                            People from different gangs joined the Christmas celebrations at my parents' house. Everybody had to leave before dinner was served. I was angry.

                            LUCIDITY! A LOT of things happened!<br/>
                            I was in Spain, carrying a younger version of my son and checked my tattoo. It was blurred out, and then I knew I was dreaming. Attempted to fly on several occasions, but couldn't.<br/>
                            At Parken Stadium for the Copenhagen Derby, I discovered that I also couldn't just walk in without paying, just like I couldn't conjure money into existence at a grocery store.
