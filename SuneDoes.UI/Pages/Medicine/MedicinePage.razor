                        <p>This is a nasty one, and the cause of a majority of opioid-related deaths under the current opioid epidemic.
                            Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate that you can think of kind of like <b><i>Heroin on Steroids </i></b> and is
                            deadly even in very small amounts. For an idea of its potency, know that it is sometimes administered in bandages for 
                            a very limited amount to be absorbed through the skin.
                        </p>
                        <p>Though fentanyl is at times applied in hospitals, you are probably more likely to stumble upon it 
                            buying counterfeit prescription painkillers, for instance the so-called 'pressed blues' (a boardwalk-impersonation of OxyContin).

                            If you are a child of the 1980's like me, you are very unlikely to unsuspectingly find yourself in possession of heroin believing
                            it to be a harmless painkiller. In fact, if you are in possession of heroin you are probably busy examining your feet for 
                            an uninfected vein to shoot up, and handing over your next shimmer of sunshine in the cold and desolate darkness that is your reality

                            Sold under brand names such as: OxyFast, OxyNorm, OxyIR (all 3 immediate-release forms) and OxyContin (extended/slow-release form),
                            oxycodone was the engine under the early 2000's US opioid epidemic, with Purdue Pharma reaking in a shitton of money as the driver behind the wheel.<br/>
                            Though the addictive 'qualities' of oxycodone are now well-known it is still regularly prescribed in either its immediate-release 
                            or extended-release forms for treatment of severe pain, for instance following surgical procedures, and most people in western societies
                            are likely to come across oxycodone at some point or another.

                            to punch your own ticket from an oxycodone overdose. If you have been prescribed oxycodone but you feel like you don't really need it

                            This is sort of a tricky one: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>on one hand, tramadol is an opioid used to treat moderate pains like long-term lower-back issues or those following from
                                    dental surgery and can be thought of as a kind of minor sibling to oxycodone
                                </li>
                                <li>on the other hand, it has serotonin reuptake-inhibiting effects similar to popular antidepressants (it actually has 
                                    serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake-inhbiting effects like the SNRI-branch of antidepressants, but no need to get all
                                    technical here)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            You are very likely to come across tramadol during the process of some kind of medical treatment as it is often a preferred 
                            choice of pain treatment (over for instance oxycodone), and is believed to have a lower potential for drug abuse/addiction. 
                            It's effect on its users vary more than other opioids (from its SNRI-properties I suppose, but what do I know?): some users find tramadol very effective 
                            in treatment of pain, some users feel very ill when taking tramadol, and some (ab)users like to chug a couple of 100 grams of tramadol
                            before going on a bender, reporting a calmer buzz when combining alcohol-intake with tramadol.

                            If you are prescribed tramadol as part of some kind of medical treatment and it works for you: go ahead. Follow the doctor's 
                            orders when it comes time to taper off, and enjoy your flirt with opioids. If you find it hard to taper off the meds or find yourself
                            in a prolonged period of bleakness after having stopped taking tramadol, you may be dealing with more than opioid withdrawal: 
                            you may be reacting to a serotonin-deficiency, and may benefit from treatment with antidepressants. If this is the case, contact
                            your doctor and if for some reason or other this is not an option, feel free to reach out to Doctor Sune ❤ <br/>
                            If you are prescribed tramadol and it just isn't working for you, contact Doctor Sune and I'll help you get rid of it in a safe and
                            ecologically viable way.

                            Actual amphetamine is seldomly used for medical treatments, but amphetamine-like drugs like methylphenidate and lisdexamphetamine is
                            often used to treat behavioural disorders like ADD and ADHD. Although it is possible to do the final
                            checkout on stimulants, you are more likely to step out of the checkout line from physical discomforts like: 
                            nausea, shaking and headache before it gets to that (similar to drinking too much coffee). <br/>
                            If you are in possession of an amphetamine-like drug, chances are that:

                            <ol>
                                <li>your erratic behaviour has finally made the people closest to you demand that you be checked by a professional for
                                    a behavioural disorder
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    you have recklessly put off starting an important project/assignment and now you have just 10 hours until deadline
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    you are the parent of a young person who has recklessly put off starting an important project/assignment....
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            If no. 2 applies to you, maybe you should nip things in the bud and have a chat with your doctor about whether you may suffer 
                            from some kind of behavioural disorder, as it is not uncommon for people with dopamine deficiencies to postpone boring tasks
                            until the very last moment in order to trigger the adrenaline-release needed for them to complete the task. If no. 3 applies to 
                            you and your son/daughter, consider it an opportunity for the two of you to spend some quality time together while filling 
                            out the DIVA 2.0 ADHD diagnostic interview. If you are really lucky, you have a spouse to help you guys get through the process (though 
                            they may pull out their hair and OMG in frustration along the way). <br/>
                            The funny thing about amphetamine and the various amphetamine-like prescription drugs on the market is, that if you for some reason
                            or another end up trying them out and discovering that they have a positive effect on you, it's not unlikely that you fit the criteria
                            for being prescribed them legally and I recommend that you seriously consider this option (instead of just plowing onwards to meth 
                            and smack through the great buffet of illegal substances offered in most parts of the Western World). <br/>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 26pt; font-style: italic;">Methylphenidate</h3>
                        <p>Methylphenidate is sold under brand names like Ritalin (comes in instant-release and extended-release editions) and Concerta
                            (strictly extended-release). It is believed to have higher potential for abuse than lisdexamphetamine, 
                            since it more easily induces a sense of euphoria in the user, and it seems that most of the developmental effort put into
                            evolving products containing methylphenidate has been made to provide a more gradual onset
                            and stretch out the drugs effective duration. Some products envelop the active ingredient in small gelatine pellets, while others 
                            compartmentalize the medication within the pills. While the trend in psychiatrics these days seem to be to choose one of the 
                            extended-release forms when prescribing methylphenidate, instant-release forms that (ab)users can crush and directly snort are however
                            still in circulation.

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 26pt; font-style: italic;">Lisdexamfetamine</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lisdexamfetamine is sold under brand names like Elvanse and Vyvanse and chemically has a much longer half-life period than
                            methylphenidate (12 hours compared to 2-3 hours). While it is not uncommon for users of methylphenidate to be able to pin-point 
                            the onset of the effect of the drug to within a couple of minutes, the onset of lisdexamfetamine is so gradual that it usually doesn't
                            register with the user, which is probably a large part of the reason why the medication is believed to have a lower potential for
                            substance abuse than methylphenidate.<br/>
                            If you have recently been diagnosed with ADHD, it's not unlikely that you will have a say in what type of medication you wish to 
                            be prescribed, possibly after a period of trying out different products. At least in Denmark a couple of years ago,
                            lisdexamfetamine was considerably more expensive than methylphenidate, but if you in every other regard find that you prefer 
                            lisdexamfetamine to methylphenidate, I strongly advise you to find out if you are eligible to receive funding (through the CTR-register),
                            and perform the calculation of net-cost over an entire year in terms of actual cost when deducting the amount covered by CTR.

                            a scheduled intake of methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine (I know: hearsay and all, but feel free to google it Poindexter 🧐). <br/>
                            All any psychatrist will tell you is, that care should be taken in selecting the right drug and dosis but what that same psychiatrist 
                            may fail to mention is, that many of them are extremely overbooked and seldomly have much time for leading you through the callibration
                            process. I have some experience of trial-and-error in the field, and I may be able to provide you with information the psychiatrist
                            won't readily provide you with otherwise. Free-of-charge of course. I'll ask you to call me on my phone, ask you some questions
                            and then probably ramble on for a good 30 minutes, and if you haven't ringed off by then I'll probably go: 'Gosh! Now I'm beat... I know,
                            I know... I'm an amazing guy, and you very much appreciate the invaluable advise I have just dispensed and bla bla bla, but I'm too tired 
                            now to hear it! Catch you around town Jesper!'
